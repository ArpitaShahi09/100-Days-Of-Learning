# Day 1: Memory Management & Array Optimization

### 🧠 What I Learned Today
Today I went beyond simple coding. I studied how **Arrays** are stored in computer memory (RAM). I learned about **Contiguous Memory Allocation** and why accessing an element by index is $O(1)$ time complexity.

### 💻 Engineering Concepts
1. **Memory Pointers:** How the computer finds the address of an element.
2. **Space-Time Complexity:** Analyzing why simple loops are better than nested loops for basic searches.
3. **Clean Code Principles:** Using descriptive naming conventions and type hinting.

### 🛠️ The Challenge
Build a robust "Search Engine" logic that handles messy data and finds the "Peak" value without crashing the system.
