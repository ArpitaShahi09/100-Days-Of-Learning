# 🌸 Day 2: Dynamic Memory & Linked Lists 🎀

### 🧠 Advanced Engineering Concept
Today I studied how **Linked Lists** manage memory differently than Arrays. Instead of one big block, data is scattered in memory and connected by "pointers."

### 🛠️ Key Takeaways
- **Nodes:** The building blocks containing data and a reference.
- **Pointers:** Memory addresses that link one piece of data to the next.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ for insertion at the beginning.
